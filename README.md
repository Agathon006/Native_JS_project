# Advanced layout project (from UDEMY course)
Developed a web project focusing on nutrition and healthy eating, utilizing a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API, Promises, Async/Await, various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), LocalStorage, Modules, Imports/Exports, Webpack, and Babel.

The project offers multiple dietary plans to choose from and features a contact form for user engagement. Additionally, it includes a calorie calculator to aid in meal planning. The use of Fetch API and the various HTTP methods allows for seamless communication with a server to retrieve, save, update, and delete dietary information.

The project employs LocalStorage to store user preferences, while leveraging modern JavaScript features such as Promises, Async/Await, and module-based architecture. Webpack and Babel are used to bundle and transpile the code for browser compatibility, ensuring a smooth user experience across different environments.

## Instruction for launching this project

1. Install all needed dependencies:
   `npm install`
1. Run the json-server (back app), your server must work on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
   `npx json-server db.json`
1. Run the front app with some server (you can use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) for example). Attention: do not use LiveServer from VS Code for this as it can cause problems with POST / PUT / DELETE requests to the server.
